# HTML University UNES

## Overview

This project introduces fundamental principles of HTML by creating a basic web page for UNES (Universidad Nacional Experimental de la Seguridad). It demonstrates best practices in HTML, focusing on document structure, elements, and the use of tables, images, and links.

## Key Features

- **DOCTYPE Declaration**: The `<!doctype html>` declaration at the beginning ensures the browser interprets the document as HTML5.
- **Head Section**: Includes the `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag to set the character encoding for correct display of characters.
- **Body Structure**: Uses tables, links, and headings to organize content.

## HTML Concepts Covered

1. **Basic Structure of an HTML Document**

   The HTML document starts with a `<!doctype html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags, which define the webpage structure.

2. **Incorporating Images**

   Images are added using the `<img>` tag with the `src` attribute pointing to the image location:

   ```html
   <img src="image/logo.png" alt="University Logo">

3. Tables for Layout
This project uses an HTML `<table>` to organize content. Although modern websites typically use CSS for layout, tables are useful for understanding basic structural organization:

   ```html
   <table border="0" width="900" align="center">
   <tr>
      <td height="89"><img src="image/logo.png" alt="University Logo"></td>
      <td align="center">
         <a href="#">Menu</a> | 
         <a href="about-us.html">About Us</a> | 
         <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
      </td>
   </tr>
   <!-- More rows and cells here -->
   </table>
   
4. Navigation Links
Links are created using the <a> tag with the href attribute pointing to the destination URL. This enables navigation between pages:

   ```html
   <a href="about-us.html">About Us</a>
   
5. Text Formatting and Headings
Text is organized into paragraphs `<p>` and headings `<h2>`, with inline formatting using `<strong>` for bold and `<i>` for italic text:

   ```html
   <h2>About the University</h2>
   <p>UNES is a public university specializing in security sciences...</p>

## Learning Goals

Understand the structure of an HTML document.
Learn how to include images and create basic navigation using links.
Organize content using tables (for learning purposes) and headings.
Format text with semantic HTML tags like <strong> and <p>.
Begin incorporating external resources like images and links to build a simple, structured webpage.
